First of all, we can get optimized google search results for the specific filetypes we want for example **pdf**, **mp3** and **mp4**. We provided a search button where students need to type only the keywords of their search and automatically the results are displayed in a new tab in their respective browsers.<br><br>

Next comes our **Notes** **Taking** feature. Students can take short notes, edit them according to their requirements and save them as well. The file will be saved as “.txt” file and saved in their local computer.<br><br>

We also added a tab for contests, which displays all the live contests on coding platforms like **Codechef**, **Hackerrank**, etc. This feature saves immense time and effort benefiting the students.<br><br>

Here comes our most striking feature that we are able to provide. This feature is an app in itself. We name it **Facial** **Attendance**. This feature takes the attendance and saves the records in a “.csv” file. Only requirement is that one must have a webcam to access this feature. It runs a python script and the attendance gets uploaded in the real time in the database. The records of the attendance can be seen by visiting Attendance tab in our app.<br><br>
